1) How does Sinatra store our application files/"listen" to them?
2) Is it holding our controllers.rb file in a particular location so that all requests hit Sinatra and immediately get routed to the controller file?
3) How exactly does a server configure itself to understand how to run Sinatra/write to disk?
4) Where does postgres store the database?
5) What exactly are the differences between postgres and sqlite3?
6) How does it know which port to listen on?
7) How exactly should a user be responsible for providing wildcards that DOES NOT involve manipulating the URL in the address bar?
8) How exactly would you take a params array and pass it as an argument to a redirect which then points to another route at that argument, to potentially return another view or something from the method in which that params hash was instantiated?
